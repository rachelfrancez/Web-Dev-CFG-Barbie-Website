# Web-Dev-CFG-Barbie-Website
Made for the Code First Girls Web Development Course July 2023.

This website was made as my first experience with html, css, and javascript, as part of an eight-week Introduction to Web Development Course.

The aim was to have a site with at least two pages, with working links, an external css file and css framework (Bootstrap), and basic user interaction - as well as possiby being responsive.

My first idea was to build a website around a subject I am passionate about, so as a doll collector I have designed a site which would act as an online database containing information about Barbie dolls throughout the years. (This was also topical as this was the same month the Barbie Movie came out).

Below are screenshots of the wireframes and design documents I created for this site.

There is plenty on the site that could be tweaked and improved upon, but for my first project I am very pleased with how it turned out. I am excited to develop my front-end development skills further, and will continue to update the site as I do.

VERY IMPORTANT TO NOTE: because this website was made as part of an onlone course, and is in no way made to be a 'real' resource or monetised in any way, I have (as of yet) not credited or checked usage rights for any images featured (I know this is bad practice!). As I update the site for personal use and potentially to feature in a portfolio, I will be updating images and credits, as well as relpacing the Barbie logo with a logo of my own design. Because this repository is public, if anyone who sees this owns any of the images featured and wants them to be credited or removed, please get in touch! (email featured in website footer)
