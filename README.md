# Web-Dev-CFG-Barbie-Website
Made for the Code First Girls Web Development Course July 2023.

This website was made as my first experience with html, css, and javascript, as part of an eight-week Introduction to Web Development Course.

The aim was to have a site with at least two pages, with working links, an external css file and css framework (Bootstrap), and basic user interaction - as well as possiby being responsive.

Below are screenshots of the wireframes and design documents I created for this site.
